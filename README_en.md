This is a repository created for testing the introduction of Dapr and Zipkin. 
For trace output to Zipkin, we are using Zipkin4net. 
It appears that trace output also works when using Publisher/Subscribe, but this is untested.

Envoy has been introduced. 
Nginx has been introduced as well, but SSL support has not yet been implemented.
